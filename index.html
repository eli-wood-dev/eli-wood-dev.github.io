					Just Survive! is a first-person PVE game where you try to survive as long as possible in a zombie apocalypse.
					The game is currently in early development and the main gameplay loop is not finalized.
					The main premise and story of Just Survive is very subject to change.
					Me and my friend, <a href="https://zach-sousa-dev.github.io/">Zachary Sousa</a> are currently developing the game together.
					The game is being programmed in Unity, and my focus has been on the enemy AI and pathfinding.

					Roads of Rage is a 2d top-down action game that was developed in Greenfoot using Java by me and <a href="https://zach-sousa-dev.github.io/">Zachary Sousa</a>.
					The game is unfinished and has been mostly abandoned, but there are some interesting ideas that were enjoyable to work on.
					Roads of Rage was mostly a learning experience for us, but I plan on using the skills I learned from the game in future projects.
